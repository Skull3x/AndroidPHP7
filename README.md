# AndroidPHP7

I have recently found this while I was prancing along github. It was originally by Genisys but now Imagical Corp made they're own I'm guessing. Anyways, all you have to do is take the .zip file I have for you and before pasting it anywhere you must first download and install the app

https://github.com/ImagicalMine/IM-Android/blob/master/releases/apk/ImagicalMine_0.2.5.apk?raw=true

Then start the application and press a and then b within the console.

Now, go into your file manager and check to see if the folder Genisys or ImagicalMine is present and take the files within the archive and paste them there. Now you're done, go back into the console and press a and then b and your server will start!! Email me any errors if you need help!!

# Tips

In order to update your server to the next current version all you have to do is go to unphar.com, paste the .phar into the converter and download the archive. Then take the src of the archive and replace your current src with the new one!!

# I personally only use android to test my plugins, Android is not meant to be a(n) actual server

# This will also discontinue your current use of the PocketMine-MP application sadly. Server wise, till you're able if possible to use php7 within the app itself

I have recently found this while I was prancing along github. It was originally by Genisys but now Imagical Corp made they're own I'm guessing. Anyways, all you have to do is take the .zip file I have for you and before pasting it anywhere you must first download and install the app

https://github.com/ImagicalMine/IM-Android/blob/master/releases/apk/ImagicalMine_0.2.5.apk?raw=true

Then start the application and press a and then b within the console.

Now, go into your file manager and check to see if the folder Genisys or ImagicalMine is present and take the files within the archive and paste them there. Now you're done, go back into the console and press a and then b and your server will start!! PM me any errors if you need help!!
